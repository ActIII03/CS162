Name: Armant Touche

Instructor: Karla Fant
Program Purpose: This is program used to to manage a list of Portland State University Food carts presently located on campus.

Global Variables: 

For global variables, I want to create static array sizes for each data memember belonging to two struct I will, which are: (1) address (2) food cart. Following are the integers variables I want create: (1) char_1 = 5 (2) char_2 = 10 (3) char_3 = 15.

Main Algorithm:

    Create a struct object (I) address: (1) Address Line 1:  var -> address_line_1; data type: character array (2) City; var -> address_city; data type is character array (3) State: var -> address_state; data type is character array (4) Zip Code: var -> address_zip_code; data type is integer. Create a struct object (II) food cart: (1) Name Cart; var -> name_cart; data type is character array   (2) Location; struct_var address; data type is a struct (3) Resturant Style: var -> resturant_style; data type is character array (4) Review: var -> review; data type is character array. After creating objects I will invoke a menu interface that is accepts integer values from the user. The following will be my menu options: Invoke (1) Add Cart along with top favorite food (2) Search Carts (3) Display Carts (4) For an existing cart, delete favorite food (5) For an existing cart, add favorite food (6) Delete Cart (7) Display Cart by type of Food (8) Quit Program.

    Private Member: 

        I want to create the following variables: (1) food cart struct pointer: var -> food_cart * head (2) food cart struct pointer: var -> food_cart * head
